## About Infiniti

Infiniti is the luxury vehicle division of Japanese automaker Nissan, launched in 1989 to compete with other premium brands in the North American market. The brand has since expanded globally, offering a range of luxury sedans, coupes, SUVs, and crossovers.

## Generations

### Early Years (1989-1999)

Infiniti was established as Nissan's luxury brand, initially launching with two models: the Q45 sedan and the M30 coupe. The Q45 was the flagship model featuring a powerful V8 engine, while the brand's identity focused on a combination of luxury, performance, and Japanese craftsmanship. During this period, Infiniti expanded its lineup with models like the J30, G20, and QX4 SUV, establishing its presence in the North American luxury market.

### Growth Period (2000-2010)

The early 2000s marked a significant turning point for Infiniti with the introduction of the G35 sedan and coupe, which garnered critical acclaim and helped redefine the brand's image. This period saw the implementation of Infiniti's "dynamic performance" philosophy, with models featuring rear-wheel-drive platforms, powerful VQ-series engines, and more distinctive styling. The FX crossover was introduced as an early entrant in the luxury crossover segment, offering sporty handling combined with utility.

### Global Expansion (2011-2020)

Infiniti underwent a major rebranding strategy during this period, adopting a Q-based naming convention for all its vehicles (sedans, coupes, and convertibles became Q models, while crossovers and SUVs became QX models). The brand expanded globally into markets including Europe, China, and the Middle East. This era saw the introduction of models like the Q50, QX60, and Q60, along with advanced technologies including the world's first production variable compression engine in the QX50.

### Electrification Era (2021-Present)

The most recent period represents Infiniti's transition toward electrification. The brand has announced plans to electrify its portfolio, developing e-POWER systems and fully electric vehicles. While maintaining its focus on premium features and distinctive design, Infiniti is working to integrate new electric powertrains while preserving the performance characteristics the brand is known for. This period has seen the introduction of concept vehicles pointing toward the brand's electric future.
